	<text>You arrive at the beacon to discover an Iron Watch ship. The captain is seemingly quite distressed as you can hear yelling over the public channels.
	"What do you mean it's not a turret?" You can hear the faint noise of one of their crew trying to explain something the captain clearly doesn't understand.
	"So we were SCAMMED? That kniving merchant, ohhh if I see him again he's dead!"</text>

			<text>Eventually the captain's angry reaches a crescendo and orders the would-be turret thrown out the airlock. "I want it out of sight, get us OUT OF HERE!" With that the Iron Watch ship jumps away. Now on you're on you have time to scoop up the "turret" and examine it yourself, it turns out it was just a simple defense drone.</text>
